注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。
Many college students today own personal computers that cost anywhere from $1000 to perhaps $5000 or more. __26__, it is not uncommon for them to purchase __27__ costing another several hundred dollars. Twenty years ago, computers were __28__, but they were very large and extremely expensive. Few, if any. __29__ purchased computers for home use. Over the years, the price of the "guts" of a computer-its memory-has declined to less than a thousandth of the price per unit of memory that prevailed twenty years ago. This is the main reason why computers cost so much less today than they used to. Moreover. __30__ improvements have made it possible to __31__ memory circuitry that is small enough to fit into the portable personal computers that many of us own and use. __32__, as the price of computation has declined the average consumer and business have spent more on purchasing computers.

__33__ improved agricultural technology, hybrid(杂交) seeds. __34__ animal breeding, and so on have vastly increased the amount of output a typical farmer can produce. The prices of goods such as meats and grains have fallen sharply relative to the prices of most other goods and services. As agricultural prices have fallen, many households have decreased their total expenses on food. Even though the __35__ of a product purchased generally increases when its price falls, total expenses on it may decline.

Section B
Directions:In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Is College a Worthy Investment?
A) Why are we spending so much money on college? And why are we so unhappy about it? We all seem to agree that a college education is wonderful, and yet strangely we worry when we see families investing so much in this supposedly essential good. Maybe it's time to ask a question that seems almost sacrilegious (大不敬的): is all this investment in college education really worth it?
B) The answer, I fear, is no. For an increasing number of kids, the extra time and money spent pursuing a college diploma will leave them worse off than they were before they set foot on campus.
C) For my entire adult life, a good education has been the most important thing for middle-class households. My parents spent more educating my sister and me than they spent on their house, and they're not the only ones... and, of course, for an increasing number of families, most of the cost of their house is actually the cost of living in a good school district. Questioning the value of a college education seems a bit like questioning the value of happiness, or fun.
D) The average price of all goods and services has risen about 50 percent. But the price of a college education has nearly doubled in that time. Is the education that today's students are getting twice as good? Are new workers twice as smart? Have they become somehow massively more expensive to educate?
E) Perhaps a bit. Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economics professor, says, "I look at the data, and I see college costs rising faster than inflation up to the mid-1980s by 1 percent a year. Now I see them rising 3 to 4 percent a year over inflation. What has happened? The federal government has started dropping money out of airplanes. " Aid has increased, subsidized(补贴的) loans have become available, and "the universities have gotten the money." Economist Bryan Caplan, who is writing a book about education, agrees: "It's a giant waste of resources that will continue as long as the subsidies continue."
F) Promotional literature for colleges and student loans often speaks of debt as an "investment in yourself." But an investment is supposed to generate income to pay off the loans. More than half of all recent graduates are unemployed or in jobs that do not require a degree, and the amount of student-loan debt carried by households has increased more than five times since 1999. These graduates were told that a diploma was all they needed to succeed, but it won't even get them out of the spare bedroom at Mom and Dad's. For many, the most visible result of their four years is the loan payments, which now average hundreds of dollars a month on loan balances in the tens of thousands.
G) It's true about the money-sort of. College graduates now make 80 percent more than people who have only a high-school diploma, and though there are no precise estimates, the wage premium (高出的部分) for an outstanding school seems to be even higher. But that's not true of every student. It's very easy to spend four years majoring in English literature and come out no more employable than you were before you went in. Conversely, chemical engineers straight out of school can easily make almost four times the wages of an entry-level high-school graduate.
H) James Heckman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has examined how the returns on education break down for individuals with different backgrounds and levels of ability. "Even with these high prices, you're still finding a high return for individuals who are bright and motivated," he says. On the other hand, "if you're not college ready, then the answer is no, it's not worth it." Experts tend to agree that for the average student, college is still worth it today, but they also agree that the rapid increase in price is eating up more and more of the potential return. For borderline students, tuition(学费) rise can push those returns into negative territory.
I) Everyone seems to agree that the government, and parents, should be rethinking how we invest in higher education and that employers need to rethink the increasing use of college degrees as crude screening tools for jobs that don't really require college skills. "Employers seeing a surplus of college graduates and looking to fill jobs are just adding that requirement." says Vedder. "In fact, a college degree becomes a job requirement for becoming a bar-tender."
J) We have started to see some change on the finance side. A law passed in 2007 allows many students to cap their loan payment at 10 percent of their income and forgives any balance after 25 years. But of course, that doesn't control the cost of education! it just shifts it to taxpayers. It also encourages graduates to choose lower-paying careers, which reduces the financial return to education still further. "You're subsidizing people to become priests and poets and so forth," says Heckman. "You may think that's a good thing, or you may not." Either way it will be expensive for the government.
K) What might be a lot cheaper is putting more kids to work. Caplan notes that work also builds valuable skills- probably more valuable for kids who don't naturally love sitting in a classroom. Heckman agrees wholeheartedly: "People are different, and those abilities can be shaped. That's what we've learned, and public policy should recognize that."
L) Heckman would like to see more apprenticeship-style(学徒式) programs, where kids can learn in the workplace-learn not just specific job skills, but the kind of "soft skills," like getting to work on time and getting along with a team- that are crucial for career success. "It's about having mentors(指导者) and having workplace-based education," he says. "Time and again I've seen examples of this kind of program working."
M) Ah, but how do we get there from here? With better public policy, hopefully, but also by making better individual decisions. "Historically markets have been able to handle these things," says Vedder. "and I think eventually markets will handle this one. If it doesn't improve soon, people are going to wake up and ask, 'Why am I going to college?'"

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

A recent global survey of 2000 high-net-worth individuals found that 60% were not planning on a traditional retirement. Among US participants, 75% expected to continue working in some capacity even after stepping away from full-time jobs. "Many of these people made their wealth by doing something they're passionate (有激情的) about." says Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for Barclays Wealth Americas. "Given the choice, they prefer to continue working." Barclays calls these people "nevertirees."
Unlike many Americans compelled into early retirement by company restrictions, the average nevertiree often has no one forcing his hand. If 106-year-old investor Irving Kahn, head of his own family firm, wants to keep coming to work every day. who's going to stop him? Seventy-eight-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's job security is guaranteed in the Constitution.
It may seem that these elderly people are trying to cheat death. In fact, they are. And it's working. Howard Friedman, a professor at UC Riverside, found in his research that those who work hardest and are successful in their careers often live the longest lives. "People are generally being given bad advice to slow down, take it easy, stop worrying, and retire to Florida," he says. He described one study participant, still working at the age of 100, who was recently disappointed to see his son retire.
"We're beginning to see a change in how people view retirement," says George Leeson, co-director of the Institute of Population Ageing at Oxford. Where once retirement was seen as a brief reward after a long struggle through some miserable job, it is now akin (近似) to being cast aside. What Leeson terms "the Warren Buffett effect" is becoming more broadly appealing as individuals come to "view retirement as not simply being linked to economic productivity but also about contribution."
Observers are split on whether this is a wholly good thing. On the one hand, companies and financial firms can benefit from the wisdom of a resilient(坚韧的) chief. On the other, the new generation can find it more difficult to advance-an argument that typically holds little sway to a nevertiree.

56. What do we learn about the so-called "nevertirees"?
A) They are passionate about making a fortune.
B) They have no choice but to continue working.
C) They love what they do and choose not to retire.
D) They will not retire unless they are compelled to.

57. What do Irving Kahn and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have in common?
A) Neither of them is subject to forced retirement.
B) Neither of them desires reward for their work.
C) Both cling to their positions despite opposition.
D) Both are capable of coping with heavy workloads.

58. What is the finding of Howard Friedman's research?
A) The harder you work, the bigger your fortune will be.
B) The earlier you retire, the healthier you will be.
C) Elderly people have to slow down to live longer.
D) Working at an advanced age lengthens people's life.

59. What is the traditional view of retirement according to the passage?
A) It means a burden to the younger generation.
B) It is a symbol of a mature and civilized society.
C) It is a compensation for one's life-long hard work.
D) It helps increase a nation's economic productivity.

60. What do critics say about "nevertirees"?
A) They are an obstacle to a company's development.
B) They lack the creativity of the younger generation.
C) They cannot work as efficiently as they used to.
D) They prevent young people from getting ahead.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

When we talk about Americans barely into adulthood who are saddled with unbearable levels of debt, the conversation is almost always about student loan debt. But there's a growing body of evidence suggesting that today's young adults are also drowning in credit-card debt and that many of them will take this debt to their graves.
More than 20% overspent their income by more than $100 every single month. Since they haven't built up their credit histories yet, it's a safe bet that these young adults are paying relatively high interest rates on the resulting credit card debt.
Although many young people blame "socializing" as a barrier to saving money, most of them aren't knocking back $20 drinks in trendy (时尚的) lounges. They're struggling with much more daily financial demands.
To a disturbingly large extent, the young and the broke are relying on credit cards to make it until their next payday. This obviously isn't sustainable in the long run. and it's going to put a huge drag on their spending power even after they reach their peak earning years, because they'll still be paying interest on that bottle of orange juice or box of spaghetti (意式面条) they bought a decade earlier.
A new study out of Ohio State University found that young adults are accumulating credit card debt at a more rapid rate than other age groups, and that they're slower at paying it off. "If what we found continues to hold true, we may have more elderly people with substantial financial problems in the future," warns Lucia Dunn, professor of economics at Ohio State. "If our findings persist, we may be faced with a financial crisis among elderly people who can't pay off their credit cards."
Dunn says a lot of these young people are never going to get out from under their credit card debt. "Many people are borrowing on credit cards so heavily that payoff rates at these levels are not sufficient to recover their credit card debt by the end of their life, which could have loss implications for the credit card issuing banks."

On the Overuse of the Mobile Phone
As is shown in the picture, having a mobile phone in hand and at the ready is the default mode while walking on the streets. What this cartoon symbolically reveals is that people nowadays, especially young people, are growing increasingly dependent on their mobile phones.
It is true that the mobile phone has brought great convenience to people's life. 1. However, just as is illustrated in the picture, the overuse of it may lead to several bad consequences. Io begin with, there is evidence that long-term exposure to electromagnetic radiation may trigger many health problems, such as insomnia, headaches and even cancers. 2. In addition, when people immerse themselves in the mobile phone, they tend to pay less attention to their surroundings, posing an immediate threat to their life, health and property. Last but not least, excessive use of mobile phones means much less chance of face-to-face interactions with the people who populate their real lives. 
In conclusion, while mobile phones have contributed a lot to making our life more convenient, we should use them appropriately and rationally.

The Chinese knot, originally invented by the craftsmen, has become an elegant and colorful art and craft over hundreds of years' improvement. In ancient times, it was used to record events, but nowadays it is mainly functioning as decorations. " Knot" signifies love, marriage and reunion in Chinese. Often used as gift exchanges or decorations, the Chinese knot is believed to bring good luck as well as ward off evil spirits. The handicraft has been passed down from one generation to another and now is gaining popularity both at home and abroad.
