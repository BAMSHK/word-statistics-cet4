Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes)
Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage. 

School Lunch
Ryan moved silently through the lunch line. The cook put a cheeseburger (奶酪汉堡) and an applesauce cup on his tray. He grabbed a bottle of milk from the cooler at the end of the line and found a seat in the cafeteria (食堂). Ryan saw that his friend Tyler had brought lunch from home.
"What did you bring today, Tyler?" he asked.
Tyler pulled his meal out of its brown paper sack. "I've got a ham sandwich, chips, two cupcakes, and a can of soda."
Ryan's mouth started to water. "Uh, Tyler," he said. "If you don't want one of those cupcakes, I'll take it. They sure look good. "
Tyler handed Ryan his cupcake. "Sure," he said. "I won't eat all this."

Lunch Requirements
Is Ryan eating a healthy meal if he eats the school lunch? School lunch supporters say "Yes." Recent studies show that a government-approved school lunch has more variety and is more nutritious (有营养的) than most lunches brought from home. It's also lower in fat.
The National School Lunch Act requires that school lunches go along with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans developed by the government. Meals must contain a variety of foods with plenty of grains and at least one fruit or vegetable each day. Foods must not contain too much sugar or salt.
A hot lunch can contain up to 30% fat, but not more than 10% of its calories (卡路里) should come from saturated (饱和的) fat. In an average week, you should get one-third of the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances for protein, iron, calcium (钙), and vitamins A and C from your school lunch.

Dare to Compare
Let's compare Ryan's and Tyler's meals to sec which is healthier. Ryan's hot lunch (without the cupcake from his friend) has 577 calories, 25 grams of total fat. and 12 grams of saturated fat. He had one serving of fruit, 26 grams of protein, and 483 milligrams of calcium. Ryan ate more total fat (39%) and saturated fat (19%) than the dietary guidelines recommend. However, schools can still meet the guidelines by having the numbers average out over a week of lunches.
Tyler's lunch from home (this includes both cupcakes) had 1 014 calories. 45 grams (40%) of total fat, and 10 grams (9%) of saturated fat. He ate 21 grams of protein and 155 milligrams of calcium, but no fruits or vegetables. Tyler's meal met the saturated fat guidelines, but had too much total fat.
Tyler ate more calories and total fat than Ryan did. Ryan ate more protein, calcium, and fruit than Tyler did. Which meal would you say is the healthier choice?

? la Carte Options
Federal standards and most school districts forbid selling food in the cafeteria that competes with the school lunch. Many programs do, however, offer à la carte choices for students who don't want the hot meal. Foods sold à la carte separate from the main meal and are priced individually. These foods do not have to meet the same nutritional standards as the foods on the hot lunch menu. Neither do the foods sold at a snack-bar or those foods available elsewhere in the school.
A study in one Texas school district compared the lunches of fourth graders who did not have food choices with those of fifth graders who could choose either a standard lunch or select from a snack-bar. The fourth graders ate 25% more fruits and vegetables than the fifth graders.
Food sold as fund-raisers can also have an impact on school lunch. The money raised is important to provide needed funds for many after-class activities. But the meal's overall nutritional quality usually goes down. Many of these foods are high in fat, sugar, or both, and often come in extralarge portions. Fundraisers rarely sell fruits and vegetables.

Choosing Wisely
School food-service programs are trying to please students, and still offer quality, nutritious meals at low cost. That task isn't easy. One school district in New York decided to do something about it. A student advisory board kept the food-service director up-to-date on what the kids wanted. They also worked with school snack-bars to sell smaller servings of chips and candy.
You can make healthy meal choices at school even when not-so-healthy choices are available. You can be sure to get a nutritious meal when you pick foods from the Food Guide Pyramid. For example, always drink milk or a calcium-rich juice for lunch. Even chocolate milk is more nutritious than soda or a sports drink. Stay away from snack foods offered à la carte. They may fill you up now, but the ones that contain a lot of fat and sugar will slow you down later. Always eat the fruits and vegetables offered at the meal. They help give you the energy and vitamins you need to get you through the rest of your school day.
Some people like to make fun of school lunches, but good nutrition is no laughing matter. Your school's hot lunch is based on the Food Guide Pyramid, so it's full of nutrition. Give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.

It's a Team Effort 
Team Nutrition is a program that gets schools excited about healthy eating. Schools across the nation pick a team leader who develops fun nutrition activities. The leader works with students, teachers, parents, food-service workers, and people from the community. Activities can range from running a school health fair to planting a garden. 
At the Jordan Community School in Chicago, Illinois, one group of fifth graders showed off their "pizza(比萨饼)garden" in a big, colorful poster showing vegetarian pizzas. The students and food-service staff planted and took care of the vegetables that they would later use as ingredients on their pizzas. The group started growing the plants in the school's cafeteria. Then they moved them outdoors to the students' demonstration garden. 
This is just one way to get everyone involved in making school lunch healthy and fun. Team up with your own group and see how creative you can get.

Section B 

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 

Libraries are my world. I've been a patron (老主顾) all my life, and for the past nine years I've worked at multiple libraries and archives in and around Detroit. The library as an institution has many roles, but as our country struggles through an economic crisis, I have watched the library where I work evolve into a career and business center, a community gathering place and a bastion (堡垒) of hope.
In the spring of 2007 1 got a library internship (实习生的位置) at the Southfield Public Library (SPL), just north of Detroit. Summers at SPL were usually slow, but that year, we experienced a library that was as busy as science-fair project week, midterms or tax season. Yet patrons weren't looking for Mosby's Nursing Drug Reference or tax return forms. They were coming for information on growing their small business.
I interpreted people's interest in our business collection as the first step to pursuing their dreams, but these patrons were not motivated by dreams. They were responding to reality, and they were looking for Plan B.
Things worsened in 2008, and in 2009 the economic crisis continues to plague Michigan. Last year, we put up a display with a variety of job resources that we restocked every hour. Each night the library closed, the display was bare. While we normally keep displays up for a week, we kept the job resources display up for months.
Then there's the tightening credit market. People see the writing on the wall and they want to get educated. They can't afford a financial adviser, but checking books out is free. Some of the most popular titles now are Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Think and Grow Rich, and Suze Orman's 2009 Action Plan.
The economic downturn affects us all. I have had to work long hours and don't get to see much of my boyfriend or experience any kind of social life lately, but I am thankful to be in a position where I can help people overcome this struggle. In Michigan, we haven't lost hope. As long as there are libraries here, there will always be hope.

Passage Two 
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. 

More than three dozen billionaires, including well-known philanthropist (慈善家) David Rockefeller, have promised at least half of their fortunes to charity, joining a programme that Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett started in June to encourage other wealthy people to give.
The pledge is currently worth about $ 150 billion, but the programme predicts it will eventually be worth $ 600 billion.
"During even the Depression's worst years, my parents gave money - about 8% of their annual income of $ 2200," said Lorry Lokey, one of the donors, on the website of the programme, the Giving Pledge, "I remember saying to my mother that we can't afford that. But she said we have to share with others."
The pledge has been a matter of some debate in philanthropic and non-profit circles, with some experts dismissing it as mere publicity and others predicting that it would produce a flood of new money to support non-profit groups.
Buffett said the real value of the pledge was found in the example it set and in the sentiments (情感) expressed in the letters posted on the website.
Buffett and Gates will hold several dinners later this year to recruit more billionaires, and members of the Giving Pledge will meet annually to discuss their philanthropy.
The pair are due to meet some wealthiest people in China next month and India in March.
"We hope this catches fire in some other countries," Buffett said, "If they want to take what we think is a good idea and run with it, we will be cheering."
Buffett said the number of people who had agreed to sign on was at the high end of his expectations. He said some people who declined to sign the pledge were planning to give away most of their wealth but did not want to draw attention to those plans.
Energy tycoon (大亨) Pickens, who is worth about $ 1 billion, said in his Giving Pledge letter: "I've long stated that I enjoy making money, and I enjoy giving it away. I'm not a big fan of inherited wealth. It generally does more harm than good."
