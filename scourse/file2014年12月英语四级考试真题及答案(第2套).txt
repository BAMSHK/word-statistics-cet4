Ban Sugary Drinks that Will Add Fuel to the Obesity War

[A] On a train last Thursday, I sat opposite a man who was so fat he filled more than one seat.He was pale and disfigured and looked sick to death, which he probably was: obesity (肥胖症)leads to many nasty ways of dying. Looking around the carriage, 1 saw quite a few people likehim, including a couple of fatty children with swollen checks pressing against their eyes. Thesepeople are part of what is without exaggeration an epidemic (流行病) of obesity.
[B] But it is quite unnecessary: there is a simple idea - far from new - that could sparemillions of such people a lifetime of chronic (长期的) ill health, and at the same time save theNational Health Service(NHS)at least ￡ 14 billion a year in England and Wales. There would,you might think, be considerable public interest in it. This simple idea is that sugar is as good- or as bad - as poison and should be avoided. It is pure, white and deadly, as Professor JohnYudkin described it 40 years ago in a revolutionary book of that name. The subtitle was HowSugar Is Killing Us.
[C] In its countless hidden forms, in ready meals, junk food and sweet drinks, sugar leads toaddiction (瘾), to hormonal upsets to the appetite, to metabolic (新陈代谢的) malfunctionsand obesity and from there to type 2 diabetes (糖尿病) and its many horrible complication. Ifpeople really grasped that, they would try to kick the habit, particularly as Britain is the "fatman of Europe". They might even feel driven to support government measures to preventpeople from consuming this deadly stuff. Yet so far this idea has met little but resistance.
[D] It is not difficult to imagine the vested interests (既得利益集团) lined up against any sugarcontrol- all the food and drink manufacturers, processors, promoters and retailers who makesuch easy pickings out of the magic powers of sugar. Then there are the liberals, with whom Iwould normally side, who protest that government regulation would be yet another instanceof interference in our lives.
[E] That is true, but people should realize that you cannot have a welfare state without a nannyslate (保姆国家), to some degree. If we are all to be responsible for one another's healthinsurance, through socialized medicine, then we are all closely involved in one another's health,including everyone's eating and drinking. That has already been admitted, finally, withsmoking. But it has yet to be admitted with overeating, even though one in four adults in thiscountry is obese and that number is predicted to double by the year 2050. Quite apart fromanything else, obesity will cripple the NHS.
[F] Recently, though, there have been signs that the medical establishment is trying to soundthe alarm. Last month the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC) published a report sayingthat obesity is the greatest public health issue affecting the UK and urging government to dosomething.
[G] The report offers 10 recommendations, of which the first is imposing a tax of 20 percenton sugary drinks for at least a year, on top of the existing 20 percent value-added tax. That atleast would be an excellent start. The amounts of sugar in soft drinks are horrifying, and turnstraight to fat. As Professor Terence Stephenson, head of the AMRC, has said, sugary soft drinksare "the ultimate bad food. You are just consuming neat sugar. Your body didn't evolve tohandle this kind of thing."
[H] Precisely. The risks of eating too much fat or salt (which are very different) pale intoinsignificant compared with the harm done by sugar. And it is everywhere.
[I] It is difficult to buy anything in a supermarket, other than plain, unprepared meat, fish orvegetables, that doesn't have a large amount of sugar in it. This has come about because theprevailing scientific views of the 1960s and 1970s ignored the evidence about sugar, andinstead saw fat as the really serious risk, both to the heart and other organs, as well as thecause of obesity.
[J] The fashion was to avoid fat. But finding that food with much of its fat removed is not veryappetizing, food producers turned to sugar as a magic alternative flavor enhancer, often inthe forms of syrups (糖浆) that had recently been developed from corn, and put it generouslyinto most prepared foods and soft drinks.
[K] This stuff is not just fattening. It is addictive. It interferes with the body's metabolism,possibly via the activity of an appetite-controlling hormone. There's plenty of evidence forthis, for those who will accept the truth.
[L] Theoretically, people ought to make "healthy choices" and avoid overeating. But sugaradditives are not easy to identify and are hard to avoid. So the snacking, over-drinking andover eating that makes people fat is not really their own fault: obesity is in large partsomething that is being done to them. It should be stopped, or rather the government shouldstop it.
[M] Going round my local supermarket, I am constantly astonished that it is still legal to sellall the poisons stacked high on the shelves. The problem is that they are worse than useless.They are poisonous. They are known to be addictive. They are known to make people obese.And giving small children sweet drinks or bottles of fake juice all day long is nothing less thanchild abuse.
[N] Clearly, the sale of such stuff ought to be illegal. I hate to think of yet more governmentregulation. But a bit of tax on sweet soda and a little more health education, a bit of cookingin schools and banning vending machines (自动售货机) here and there - as suggested try theAMRC report - is not going to achieve very much. Labelling is quite inadequate. What isneeded is legislation banning high levels of sugary syrups used in foods and drinks.
[O] In June 2012, the then minister for public health said the government was not scared of thefood industry and had not ruled out legislation, because of the costs of obesity to the NHS.However, nothing has happened yet. Why not have another Jammie Dodger biscuit and forgetabout it.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling passengers on those blazing blue CitiBikes. But what about local bike shops? Is Citi Bike rolling up riders at their expense? AtGotham Bikes in Tribeca, manager W. Ben said the shop has seen an increase in its overallsales due to the bike-share program. "It's getting more people on the road," he said. JamesRyan, an employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people toease into biking in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. "They can try out abike without committing to buying one," he said.
Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But forFrank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news.Owner Frank Arroyo said his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was rolled outlast month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawnaway by Citi Bikes.
However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. "People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want somethingnicer for themselves," he noted.
Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. just north of Christopher St., saidinitially he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, "I was happy to see peopleon bikes."
Farrell's early concerns were echoed by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. "It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to implement," Crooks said of CitiBike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules andstrong negative reaction from non- cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if hisbusiness has been impacted.
While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks allowed that the idea is apositive step forward for New York City.

56. What is the author's chief concern about the increasing use of Citi Bikes in New York?
A) How non-cyclists will respond to it.
B) Whether local bike shops will suffer.
C) Whether local bike businesses will oppose it.

57. What happened to Gotham Bikes as a result of the bike-share program?
A) It found its bike sales unaffected.
B) It shifted its business to rentals.
C) It saw its bike sales on the rise.
D) It rented more bikes to tourists.

58. Why is the bike-share program bad news for Frank's Bike Shop?
A) It cannot meet the demand of the bike-share program.
B) Its customers have been drawn away by Citi Bikes.
C) Its bike prices have to be lowered again and again.
D) It has to compete with the city's bike rental shops.

59. Why did Andrew Crooks think that the bike-share program would be difficult to execute?
A) Inexperienced riders might break biking rules.
B) Conflicts might arise among bike rental shops.
C) Traffic conditions might worsen in the downtown area.
D) There are not enough lanes to accommodate the bikes.

60. What is the general attitude of the local bike shops towards Citi Bike?

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
Various studies have shown that increased spending on education has not led to measurableimprovements in learning. Between 1980 and 2008. staff and teachers at U.S. public schoolsgrew roughly twice as fast as students. Yet students showed no additional learning inachievement tests.
Universities show similar trends of increased administration personnel and costs withoutgreater learning, as documented in Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa's recent book AcademicallyAdrift Limited Learning on College Campuses.
A survey shows that 63% of employers say that recent college graduates don't have the skillsthey need to succeed and 25% of employers say that entry-level writing skills are lacking.
Some simplistically attribute the decline in our public education system to the drain of theskilled students by private schools, but far more significant events were at work.
Public schools worked well until about the 1970s. In fact, until that time, public schoolsprovided far better education than private ones. It was the underperforming students who werethrew out of public schools and went to private ones.
A prominent reason public schools did well was that many highly qualified women had fewoptions for working outside the house other than being teachers or nurses. They acceptedrelatively low pay, difficult working conditions, and gave their very best.
Having such a large supply of talented women teachers meant that society could pay less fortheir services. Women's liberation opened up new professional opportunities for women, and,over time, some of the best left teaching as a career option, bringing about a gradual declinein the quality of schooling.
Also around that time, regulations, government, and unions came to dictate pay, preventadjustments, and introduce bureaucratic (官僚的) standard for adjustment. Large educationbureaucracies and unions came to dominate the landscape, confusing activity withachievement. Bureaucrats regularly rewrite curriculums, talk nonsense about the theories ofeducation, and require ever more administrators. The end result had been that, after all thespending, students have worse math and reading skills than both their foreign peers and earliergenerations spending far less on education - as all the accumulating evidence nowdocuments.
