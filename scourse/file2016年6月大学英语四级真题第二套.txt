Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs Identify the paragraphfrom which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Eachparagraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter onAnswer Sheet 2.
Finding the Right Home-and Contentment,Too
[A] When your elderly relative needs to enter some sort of long-term care facility-a momentfew parents or children approach without fear-what you would like is to have everything madeclear.
[B] Does assisted living really mark a great improvement over a nursing home, or has theindustry simply hired better interior designers? Are nursing homes as bad as people fear, or isthat an out-moded stereotype (固定看法)? Can doing one's homework really steer families tothe best places? It is genuinely hard to know.
[C] I am about to make things more complicated by suggesting that what kind of facility anolder person lives in may matter less than we have assumed. And that the characteristicsadult children look for when they begin the search are not necessarily the things that make adifference to the people who are going to move in. I am not talking about the quality of care,let me hastily add. Nobody flourishes in a gloomy environment with irresponsible staff anda poor safety record. But an accumulating body of research indicates that some distinctionsbetween one type of elder care and another have little real bearing on how well residents do.
[D] The most recent of these studies, published in The Journal of Applied Gerontology, surveyed150 Connecticut residents of assisted living, nursing homes and smaller residential care homes(known in some states as board and care homes or adult care homes). Researchers from theUniversity of Connecticut Health Center asked the residents a large number of questions abouttheir quality of life, emotional well-being and social interaction, as well as about thequality of the facilities.
[E]"We thought we would see differences based on the housing types," said the lead author ofthe study, Julie Robison, an associate professor of medicine at the university. A reasonableassumption- don't families struggle to avoid nursing homes and suffer real guilt if theycan't?
[F] In the initial results, assisted living residents did paint the most positive picture. They wereless likely to report symptoms of depression than those in the other facilities, for instance, andless likely to be bored or lonely. They scored higher on social interaction.
[G] But when the researchers plugged in a number of other variables, such differencesdisappeared. It is not the housing type, they found, that creates differences in residents'responses. "It is the characteristics of the specific environment they are in, combined withtheir own personal characteristics-how healthy they feel they are, their age and maritalstatus," Dr. Robison explained. Whether residents felt involved in the decision to move andhow long they had lived there also proved significant.
[H] An elderly person who describes herself as in poor health, therefore, might be no lessdepressed in assisted living (even if her children preferred it) than in a nursing home. Aperson who had input into where he would move and has had time to adapt to it might do aswell in a nursing home as in a small residential care home, other factors being equal. It is aninteraction between the person and the place, not the sort of place in itself, that leads tobetter or worse experiences. "You can't just say, 'Let's put this person in a residential care homeinstead of a nursing home-she will be much better off,'" Dr. Robison said. What matters, sheadded, "is a combination of what people bring in with them, and what they find there."
[I] Such findings, which run counter to common sense, have surfaced before. In a multi-statestudy of assisted living, for instance, University of North Carolina researchers found that a hostof variables-the facility's type, size or age; whether a chain owned it; how attractive theneighborhood was-had no significant relationship to how the residents fared in terms of illness,mental decline, hospitalizations or mortality. What mattered most was the residents, physicalhealth and mental status. What people were like when they came in had greaterconsequence than what happened once they were there.
[J] As I was considering all this, a press release from a respected research firm crossed mydesk, announcing that the five-star rating system that Medicare developed in 2008 to helpfamilies compare nursing home quality also has little relationship to how satisfied its residentsor their family members are. As a matter of fact, consumers expressed higher satisfactionwith the one-star facilities, the lowest rated, than with the five-star ones. (More on this studyand the star ratings will appear in a subsequent post.)
[K] Before we collectively tear our hair out-how are we supposed to find our way in alandscape this confusing?-here is a thought from Dr. Philip Sloane, a geriatrician (老年病学专家) at the University of North Carolina："In a way, that could be liberating for families."
[L] Of course, sons and daughters want to visit the facilities, talk to the administrators andresidents and other families, and do everything possible to fulfill their duties. But perhaps theydon't have to turn themselves into private investigators or Congressional subcommittees. "Families can look a bit more for where the residents are going to be happy," Dr. Sloane said.And involving the future resident in the process can be very important.
[M] We all have our own ideas about what would bring our parents happiness. They have theirideas, too. A friend recently took her mother to visit an expensive assisted living/nursing homenear my town. I have seen this place-it is elegant, inside and out. But nobody greeted thedaughter and mother when they arrived, though the visit had been planned; nobody introducedthem to the other residents. When they had lunch in the dining room, they sat alone at a table.
[N] The daughter feared her mother would be ignored there, and so she decided to move herinto a more welcoming facility. Based on what is emerging from some of this research, thatmight have been as rational a way as any to reach a decision.
36. Many people feel guilty when they cannot find a place other than a nursing home for theirparents.
37. Though it helps for children to investigate care facilities, involving their parents in thedecision-making process may prove very important.
38. It is really difficult to tell if assisted living is better than a nursing home.
39. How a resident feels depends on an interaction between themselves and the care facilitythey live in.
40. The author thinks her friend made a rational decision in choosing a more hospitableplace over an apparently elegant assisted living home.
41. The system Medicare developed to rate nursing home quality is of little help to finding asatisfactory place.
42. At first the researchers of the most recent study found residents in assisted living facilitiesgave higher scores on social interaction.
43. What kind of care facility old people live in may be less important than we think.
44. The findings of the latest research were similar to an earlier multi-state study of assistedliving.
45. A resident's satisfaction with a care facility has much to do with whether they hadparticipated in the decision to move in and how long they had stayed there.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concernsthat robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer scienceprofessor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code.
Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate ourmorals into AI language.
For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat inthe oven to make dinner for the hungry children. "You would want that robot preloaded with agood set of values," said Russell.
Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robotshave been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there arecultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in yourpersonal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person woulddo.
It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way toset out human values as clear rules.
Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on humanbehavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless.
The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to dosufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo (禁忌).
One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with ahuman when presented with an unusual situation.
If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunityto stop, send out beeps (嘟嘟声), and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren'tquite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else.
The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe is moral,and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could begood for humanity.
46. What does the author say about the threat of robots?
A) It may constitute a challenge to computer programmers.
B) It accompanies all machinery involving high technology.
C) It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.
D) It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.
47. What would we think of a person who invades our personal space according to the author?
A) They are aggressive.
B) They are outgoing.
C) They are ignorant.
D) They are ill-bred.
48. How do robots learn human values?
A) By interacting with humans in everyday life situations.
B) By following the daily routines of civilized human beings.
C) By picking up patterns from massive data on human behavior.
D) By imitating the behavior of properly brought-up human beings.
49. What will a well-programmed robot do when facing an unusual situation?
A) Keep a distance from possible dangers.
B) Stop to seek advice from a human being.
C) Trigger its built-in alarm system at once.
D) Do sufficient testing before taking action,
50. What is most difficult to do when we turn human values into a programmable code?
A) Determine what is moral and ethical.
B) Design some large-scale experiments.
C) Set rules for man-machine interaction.
D) Develop a more sophisticated program.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

Why do some people live to be older than others? You know the standard explanations: keepinga moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality haveon your longevity (长寿)? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study inthe Journal of American Geriatrics Society looked at this question by examining the personalitycharacteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100.
The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and lessneurotic(神经质的)than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympatheticand cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement withwhat you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and helpothers can gather enough resources to make it through tough times.
Interestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had noimpact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to newideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old peoplewho are fixed in their ways.
Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of alongstanding psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life,you should strive to be as outgoing as possible.
Unfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also helpdetermine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and foundthat those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed theirkids unhealthy diets. Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults,which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger.
Personality isn't destiny (命运), and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change. Butboth studies show that long life isn't just a matter of your physical health but of your mentalhealth.
51. The aim of the study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is ____.
A) to see whether people's personality affects their life span
B) to find out if one's lifestyle has any effect on their health
C) to investigate the role of exercise in living a long life
D) to examine all the factors contributing to longevity
52. What does the author imply about outgoing and sympathetic people?
A) They have a good understanding of evolution.
B) They are better at negotiating an agreement.
C) They generally appear more resourceful.
D) They are more likely to get over hardship.
53. What finding of the study might prove somewhat out of our expectation?
A) Easy-going people can also live a relatively long life.
B) Personality characteristics that prove advantageous actually vary with times.
C) Such personality characteristics as self-discipline have no effect on longevity.
D) Readiness to accept new ideas helps one enjoy longevity.
54. What does the recent study of Norwegian mothers show?
A) Children's personality characteristics are invariably determined by their mothers.
B) People with unhealthy eating habits are likely to die sooner.
C) Mothers' influence on children may last longer than fathers'.
D) Mothers' ，negative personality characteristics may affect their children's life spans.
55. What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies?
A) Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.
B) Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health.
C) Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is.
D) Health is in large part related to one's lifestyle.
